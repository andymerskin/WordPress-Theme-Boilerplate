WordPress-Theme-Boilerplate
===========================

This is kind of a rough, barebones starting point I use for my WordPress themes. It's far from complete, but it's a good start. Initializr and Breakpoint for SASS included.

*Note:* I recommend adding [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) or [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) to your project for great mixin support.

Also includes asset directory constants in the **functions.php** file.

Usage: `<img src="<?php echo IMG; ?>/your-image-file.png" alt="" />`

### Configuration

1. Create a new folder in your **wp-content/themes** directory, dump all of this in there, give it a cool name.
2. Edit the **style.css** file to change your WordPress [theme stylesheet](http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development).
3. Apply your theme.
4. Start creating!
