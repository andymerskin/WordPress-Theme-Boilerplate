WordPress-Theme-Boilerplate
===========================

This is kind of a rough starting point for my WordPress themes. It's far from complete, but it's a good start. Initializr and Breakpoint for SASS included.

*Note:* I recommend adding [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) or [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) to your project for great mixin support.

Also includes asset directory constants in the **functions.php** file.

## Configuration

1. Create a new folder in your **themes** directory, dump all of this in there, give it a cool name.
2. Edit the **style.css** file to change your WordPress Theme Configuration.
3. Apply your theme.
4. Start creating!
